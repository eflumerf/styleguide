The DUNE C++ style guide this script tries to look for violations of can be found in 
https://github.com/DUNE-DAQ/styleguide/blob/dune-daq-cppguide/dune-daq-cppguide.md

Given a file, it will apply a linter (dunecpplint.py) to that file

Given a directory, it will apply dunecpplint.py to all the source
(*.cxx, *.cpp) and header (*.hpp) files in that directory as well as all of its
subdirectories.
