    Usage: $(basename $0) <directory containing the compile_commands.json file for your build> <file or directory to examine> 

Given a file, it will apply two linters to that file:

-dunecpplint.sh, which calls dunecpplint.py, a DUNE version of Google's cpplint.py
-duneclang-tidy.sh, which wraps clang-tidy (if the file is a sourcefile and not a header)

Given a directory, it will apply these linters to all the source
(*.cpp, *.cxx) and header (*.hpp) (if applicable) files in that directory as
well as all of its subdirectories.


compile_commands.json is a file which this script needs to forward to
clang-tidy. It can be automatically produced in a cmake build; to get
cmake to do this, add the following line to your CMakeLists.txt file:

set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON CACHE BOOL "Set to ON to produce a compile_commands.json file which clang-tidy can use" FORCE)

More detail can be found in
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html
